////this file is to store all of our questions. And all these questions will be formatted using the question class so they will each have a question task as well as answer property.
//
////So now we've created our datamodel, datamodel are used to manage and manipulate data. So we have this question bank that contains the 13 question object and we're going to use those question in our app in order to display the question and check for the answers.

//    var list =  [Question]() //will contain question objects
//
//    //and in order to fill it with content we're going to use initialization method again
//    init() {
//
////think of this line as the format for the above codes, each line of codes below will be formatted into this line, in which we implemented on the Question file.
//                                    //creating a new question + usingthe initialization method.
